>  The app has both front-end and back-end. Front-end has been implemented in React 
   and back-end is in Express.js

>  Please clone this Github repository. A new folder named Activity-Viewer will be 
   created. This folder has back-end files. Front-end files are in a folder called 
   client.

>  To run the application, node-modules have to be installed. Go inside the 
   Activity-Viewer folder and type npm i in the terminal. This installs 
   node-modules for back-end.
  
>  To install node-modules for front-end, go inside client folder and type 
   npm i
   
>  To start the back-end, open a terminal in Activity-Viewer and run the command: 
   npm start

>  To start the front-end, open a terminal in Activity-Viewer/client folder 
   and run the command: npm start
